Description: Implements several methods to estimate effects of generalized 
    time-varying treatment strategies on the mean of an outcome at one or more 
    selected follow-up times of interest. Specifically, the package implements 
    the time-smoothed inverse probability weighted estimators described in  
    McGrath et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2509.13971>. Outcomes may be repeatedly, 
    non-monotonically, informatively, and sparsely measured in the data source. 
    The package also supports settings where outcomes are truncated by death, 
    i.e. some individuals die during follow-up which renders the outcome of 
    interest undefined at the follow-up time of interest.
