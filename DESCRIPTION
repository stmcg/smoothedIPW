Description: Implements several inverse probability weighted estimators of 
    generalized time-varying treatment effects when outcomes are repeatedly
    measured and may be truncated by death. Specifically, this package 
    implements the time-smoothed and non-smoothed IPW methods described in 
    McGrath et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2509.13971>.
